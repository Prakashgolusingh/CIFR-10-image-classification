# CIFR-10-image-classification
n this project i have used a image dataset of 50k , and trained my keras sequential neural network with 40k but i got low accuracy of(0,4080). so with transfer learning approach i used a pre-trained CNN model Resnet-50 with dataset Imagenet. then again trained this model using my dataset CIFR-10 and got accuracy of 0.938
