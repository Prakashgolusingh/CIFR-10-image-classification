# CIFR-10-image-classification
In this project i have used a image dataset of 50k , and trained using ANN with 40k dataset but i got low accuracy of around 40% .
So with transfer learning approach used a pre-trained CNN model Resnet-50 with dataset Imagenet, with excluded connected layer then trained it using my dataset CIFR-10 and got accuracy of 93.8%.
