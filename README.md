# CIFR-10-image-classification
In this project i have used a image dataset of 50,000 in which 40,000 as training data and 10,000 as test data then i created basic keras sequential neural network, but i has low accuracy (0,4080). so then i used a pre-trained CNN model Resnet-50 with dataset Imagenet. then i trainded it using my dataset CIFR-10 with accuracy of 0.9386
